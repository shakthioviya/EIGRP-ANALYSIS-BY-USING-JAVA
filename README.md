# EIGRP-ANALYSIS-BY-USING-JAVA
Description
📡 EIGRP Analysis using Java

This project is a Java implementation of Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) analysis.
It simulates routing in a network of multiple routers by allowing the user to input bandwidth and delay, then calculates EIGRP metrics and generates routing tables.

🚀 Features

Computes EIGRP cost using bandwidth and delay.

Simulates multi-router topologies.

Builds routing tables with destination, next hop, and metric.

Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path calculation.

CLI-based, lightweight, and beginner-friendly.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java

Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Input: Bandwidth (kbps), Delay (ms)

Output: Routing tables

This project serves as a simple yet powerful tool to understand EIGRP routing and metric computation through hands-on Java simulation.
